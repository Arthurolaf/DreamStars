# resurrected stars - DreamStars

## prehistory

Google-translater --
Ðžnce upon a time there was an old game that I played in the far 19-9X years. It was called Stars!
It was a space strategy and I liked it so much that I played it day and night.
Then I grew up, finished school, got a good job and got married. But the memory of Stars! didn't fade away.
But since it can only be played on old windwos 3.1 or 95-98
It occurred to me to resurrect her from my memory.
